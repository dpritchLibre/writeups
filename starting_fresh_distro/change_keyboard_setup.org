* Change the keyboard setup for varying systems

** Lubuntu

*** Caps Lock mapped to Control (Lubuntu 16.04)

I Found this answer https://askubuntu.com/a/586419/447630, but instead of
=caps:none=, we want =ctrl:nocaps= (does =caps:ctrl_modifier= work as well?).  I
found the new command by going to the man page for =setxkbmap= and then
following it to the man page for =xkeyboard-config=.

I.e. use the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  setxkbmap -option caps:nocaps
#+END_SRC
