* Change the keyboard setup for varying systems

*** Caps Lock mapped to Control (Lubuntu 16.04)

I Found this answer https://askubuntu.com/a/586419/447630, but instead of
=caps:none=, we want =ctrl:nocaps= (does =caps:ctrl_modifier= work as well?).  I
found the new command by going to the man page for =setxkbmap= and then
following it to the man page for =xkeyboard-config=.

I.e. use the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  setxkbmap -option caps:nocaps
#+END_SRC


Save the following text to e.g. =~/.Xmodmap=.  Can we figure out how to
incorporate the above command into the script?
#+BEGIN_SRC fundamental
  ! explanation points (!) denote comments for xmodmap

  ! see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xmodmap#Reassigning_modifiers_to_keys_on_your_keyboard
  ! to understand the following code.  mod1 is the modifier that by default is
  ! applied when you hit Alt, and shift is the obvious modifier.  Note that
  ! according to the above link, you have to clear the modifiers before adding
  ! to them again, or they won't work properly.

  clear shift
  clear mod1
  add shift = Shift_L Shift_R Alt_R
  add mod1 = Alt_L Meta_L
#+END_SRC


In order to run the above script at startup, I saved the following text to
=~/.config/autostart/xmodmap.desktop=, as described at
https://askubuntu.com/a/958510/447630.
