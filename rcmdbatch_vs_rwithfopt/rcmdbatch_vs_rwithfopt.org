* The difference between =R CMD BATCH infile.R= and =R -f infile.R=

The main difference seems to be that =Rcmd=, which gets exec'd from the R shell
wrapper, has the following line.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
. "${R_HOME}/etc${R_ARCH}/Renviron"
#+END_SRC

However, experimentation shows that the environmental files set in that file are
set somehow when I run just =R=.
